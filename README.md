# SampleIRC

Internet Relay Chat project based on the Networking tutorial by One Lone Coder on YouTube. Customized with efficiency benchmarking, made for university purposes. Main idea behind it was to compare the efficiency of C++ to Erlang in application of relay chat application and network communication.

# Features

- [ ] Bases on a networking framework heavily inspired by the [YouTube C++ Networking Tutorial](https://youtu.be/2hNdkYInj4g?si=lYr7eeDpk62XSDCm) by OneLoneCoder;
- [ ] Framework can be used also for different applications, such as MMO server, custom-made MQTT server, and so on;
- [ ] Uses Boost ASIO for providing asynchonous operations and networking tools;
- [ ] Concrete client class is constructed to send big amount of requests to the server for benchmarking purposes;
- [ ] Concrete server class is able to handle multiple clients at once, in this case, implementing logic of a simple echo reply.
